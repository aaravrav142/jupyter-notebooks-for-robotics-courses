    "# Exercise 5.1 Least Squares Global Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will use the Least Squares algorithm to locate our robot given a set of known landmarks.\n",
    "Least Squares is akin to solve a system of equations of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{m \\times 1} = H_{m \\times n} \\cdot x_{n \\times 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the length of the pose, and $m$ the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple concept, nevertheless, has to be modified in order to be used to solve our problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pseudo-inverse**. Generally, to solve an equation system, we only need as many equations (or in our case observations, $z$) as variables (in our case components of the state/pose, The typical approach is to drop some of the additional equations, but we have to assume that $z$ has been affected by some noise, we may use the additional information to correct the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The solution: we make use of the *pseudo-inverse* of a matrix. This, in contrast to the normal inverse operation, can be used in non-square matrices. This operation will result in the closest possible $\\hat{x}$, i.e. the one where the the error is minimal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\hat{x} = \\underbrace{(H^T H)^{-1} H^T}_{\\textit{pseudo-inverse }(H^+)} z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted measurements** (optional). Not all observations are created equally, in some cases we can introduce how important each measurement is. For example, in this assignment, our sensor's accuracy drops the further the observed landmark is. Given a *covariance* matrix $Q$ describing the error in the measurements, the equations above changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "    \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "      &\\hat{x} \\leftarrow (H^T Q^{-1} H)^{-1} H^T Q^{-1} z &\\text{(1. Best estimation)}\\\\ \n",
    "      &\\Sigma_{\\hat{x}} \\leftarrow (H^T Q^{-1} H)^{-1} &\\text{(2. Uncertainty of the estimation)}\\\\\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Non-linear Least Squares**. Until now we have assumed $\\hat{x}$ can be solved as a simple system of equations, i.e. $H$ is a matrix. Nevertheless, our observation model is non linear: $z = h(x)$. Therefore, the only solution available is iterative: the *Gauss-Newton algorithm*.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "      &\\hat{x} \\leftarrow (\\dots)  &\\text{(1. Initial guess)} \\\\\n",
    "      &\\delta \\leftarrow (J_e^T Q^{-1} J_e)^{-1} J_e^T  Q^{-1} e  &\\text{(2. Evaluate delta/increment)} \\\\\n",
    "      &\\hat{x} \\leftarrow \\hat{x} - \\delta &\\text{(3. Update estimation)} \\\\\n",
    "      &\\textit{if }\\delta > \\textit{tolerance} \\rightarrow \\textit{goto (1.)} \\\\\n",
    "      &\\textit{else } \\rightarrow \\textit{return }\\hat{x} &\\text{(4. Exit condition)}\\\\\n",
    "  \\end{aligned}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - $Q$ is the measurement covariance (*weighted measurement*)\n",
    "  - $J_e$ is the Jacobian of the observation model at $\\hat{x}$, also known as $\\nabla h_{\\hat{x}}$\n",
    "  - $e$ is the error of $z$ against $h(\\hat{x})$ (computed using the map information).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Assignment**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The attached code partially implements the global localization of a robot equipped with a range\n",
    "sensor by means of Least Squares. This is done by the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The map is built. In this case, the map consists of a number of landmarks (`nLandmarks`).\n",
    "2. The program asks the user to set the true position of the robot (`xTrue`) by clicking with the mouse in the map.\n",
    "3. A new pose is generated from it, `xOdom`, which represents the pose that the robot thinks it is in. This simulates a motion command from an arbitrary pose that ends up with the robot in `xTrue`, but it thinks that it is in `xOdom`.\n",
    "4. Then the robot takes a range measurement to each landmark in the map.\n",
    "5. Finally, the robot employs a Least Squares definition of the problem and Gauss-Newton to iteratively optimize such a guess, obtaining a new (and hopefully better) estimation of its pose `xEst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows an example of execution of this code (once completed).\n",
