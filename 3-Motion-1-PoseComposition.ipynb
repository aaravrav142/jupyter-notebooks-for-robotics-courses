    "\n",
    "A fundamental aspect of the development of mobile robots is the motion itself. This is not a trivial matter as it is one of the main sources of uncertainty and other constraints to the movement difficult its implementation.\n",
    "This particular lesson introduces the concept of a robot's pose and how we deal with it in a probabilistic context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pose itself can take multiple forms depending on the problems context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2D location**: In a planar context we only need to a 2d vector $[x, y]^T$ to locate a robot against a point of reference, the origin $(0, 0).$\n",
    "- **2D pose**: In most cases involving mobile robots, the location alone is insufficient. We need an aditional paramater known as orientation or *bearing*. Therefore, a robot's pose is usually expressed as $[x, y, \\theta]^T$. *In the rest of the course, we mostly refer to this one.*\n",
    "- **3D pose**: Although we will only mentioned in passing, for robotics applications in the 3D space, *i.e.* UAV or drones, not only a third axis $z$ is added, but to handle the orientation in a 3D environment we need 3 components, *i.e.* roll, pitch and yaw. This course is centered around planar movile robots so we will not use this one, nevertheless most methods could be adapted to 3D environments."
