    "The motion planning problem consists in deciding a set of movements that allow the robot to complete a given task.\n",
    "In the real world this is complicated by various factors, e.g. the geometry of the robot, the variability of the obstacles, the non-holonomic constraints of the movement, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motion planning can be divided further into two paralel problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global navigation**: Which uses the available map to find the a sequence of movements to achieve one's goal.\n",
    "- **Local reactive navigation**: Which uses sensor information to avoid the obstacles in its path, even those which don't appear in the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will deal with a simplified version of the latter. For this endeavor, we ask you to complete the following algorithm based on the Potential Fields method. This algorithm computes an *attractive force* towards the goal and a *repulsive force* against the obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our demo, we create a random map full of obstacles, then you ought to click the starting position of a robot, and a goal position, then the robot will navigate according your implementation of the algorithm. Then you just have to enjoy watching how the robot moves!"
